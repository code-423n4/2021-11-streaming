# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

[ ‚≠êÔ∏è SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE ]

This repo consists of 3 main contracts:
| Contract Name    | Description      | SLOC |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| `StreamFactory`  | A factory for creating `Streams`      | \~600 |
| `Stream`         | A contract for managing 2 counterparty token lockup rental & buying        | \~80 |
| `LockeERC20`     | Inherited by `Stream`, this turns `Stream` deposits into a transferable ERC20| \~200 |


### External Calls
`StreamFactory` : The stream factory cannot make external calls
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

`Stream`: Each stream interacts with arbitrary contracts in everyday operation.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Notably:
  1. There is flashloan capability. Therefore, a user can call an arbitrary contract with a stream as `msg.sender`. There are strong checks around important balances here.
  2. The governor can make arbitrary calls to any address *except* `rewardToken` and `depositToken`, as well as any token that is incentivizing the streamer
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>


`LockeERC20`: relatively standard ERC20 (only difference is a timelock on when transfers start)


### Libraries
`Solmate` from Rari Capital is used extensively as well as `DSTest` from dapphub for tests.

### Testing
Download & use `dapp`. `dapp test` to run all tests.

### Uniqueness
We take a lot of inspiration for Synthetix's Staker contract, but add virtual balances to handle the fact that real balances are streamed over to the other counterparty.

### ERC20 conformity
We maintain erc20 conformity with the caveat that transfers are not possible before the end of a streaming period.

### Where to focus/areas of concern
1. Arbitrary calls making it not trustless for the 2 counterparites
2. Flashloans
3. Math around virtual balances + time restrictions on capital flows
4. RecoverTokens functionality - attempted to enable creator to withdraw accidentally sent `depositTokens` and `rewardTokens`, which causes complexity


## Contract Overview
### `StreamFactory`

This contract is a factory that generates `Streams`. It has 6 governable parameters. The only limitation should be on `feePercent` which should not exceed 5%.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

The main entry is for DAOs to call `createStream`, passing in a token they are going to be rewarding depositors (the `rewardToken`), the deposit token, the start time of the stream, how long the stream lasts, how long deposits are locked for _after_ the end of the stream, and how long rewards are locked _after_ the end of the stream.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Calling the function should deploy a new contract with a unique id and pass in the factory's fee parameters + the creator's parameters.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Updating of stream limits + fee limits are only accessible to the `governor` of the contract. This governorship is updateable in a 2 step process.


### `Stream`
#### Lifecycle
A stream is created by a stream creator. This initializes a bunch of immutable values, mostly to do with the lifetime of the contract. The lifetime can be broken down as follows:
1. Creation
2. Funding + Staking period
3. Stream + Staking period
4. Deposit Locked period
5. Claiming period
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

The lifetimes are defined by the following variables
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

`Creation`: self explanatory
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

`Funding + Staking`: creation thru `startTime`
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

`Streaming + Staking`: `startTime` thru `startTime + streamDuration` (`endStream`)
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

`Deposit Locked`: `endStream` thru `endDepositLock`
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>


`Claiming`: for rewards `endRewardLock`, for deposits `endDepositLock` thru infinity (technically to `block.timestamp = 2**32`)
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

##### Creation
Creation is just the construction of the contract. It sets a bunch of immutables mostly to do with lifecylce timing, fees, and tokens. Of note, there is a `isSale`, which denotes that the depositors *are selling their deposit tokens* for the _rewardToken_. 
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

##### Funding + Staking Period
Once a contract is created, it is ready to be funded by _anyone_, via the `fundStream` function. This function should support any ERC20 as the `rewardToken` besides rebasing tokens which is explicitly out of scope. Fee on transfer tokens and no-return ERC20s are in scope. Additionally, ERC20s whose balance may go above `type(uint112).max` are unsupported, similar to uniswap V2. 
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Additionally, if the `StreamFactory` had fees enabled, the governor of the factory contract should be able to collect the fees which should be a percentage of the `rewardToken`s used to fund the stream.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

During this time, user can also deposit their `depositTokens`, via the `stake` function. The stream hasn't started yet so no rewards should stream to them yet though. Additionally, the user should be able to withdraw their entire balance via the `exit` function prior to the stream starting, or specify an amount of `depositTokens` to withdraw via the `withdraw` function.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

##### Stream + Staking period
Once a stream has started, `depositTokens` become linearly locked until `endDepositLock` (unless it is a sale, in which case they are claimable by the stream creator). 
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC before `startTime`, as soon as the clock passes `startTime`, tokens should become locked linearly over the `streamDuration`. So if the stream duration is 100 seconds, each second, 1 USDC would be locked until `endDepositLock`.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

What the depositor gets in return is a continuous stream of `rewardTokens`. The amount of `rewardTokens` should be equivalent to each depositors % of the unstreamed amounts becoming locked. So if you represent 20% of the tokens being streamed, you should earn 20% of the reward tokens _while your tokens represent that 20%_. If the % changes, your reward should change as well, while maintaining the previous rewards. This is basically like other Synthetix Rewards contract, with the added caveat that your actual balance _decreases_ over time as tokens become locked. To work around this, we use `virtualBalances`, which takes into account how much of the remaining `rewardTokens` can you fight to earn. This is detailed in the `dilutedBalance` function. 
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Withdrawing during this timeperiod has some caveats as well, as some of your tokens will have already been locked. So we must keep track of the remaining unlocked tokens that are still available to withdraw (`TokenStream.tokens`).
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

There is a helper `exit` function that just withdraws your remaining balance.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

Additionally, there is an ERC20 minted (if its not a sale), that represents your deposit into the protocol. This becomes transferable afterward and will be needed to reclaim your deposit tokens after `endDepositLock`.
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

##### Deposit Locked period
At this point, all deposit tokens should be locked and the receipt tokens minted should be transferable. Once the `streamDuration` has elapsed, if `isSale`, the creator can withdraw the deposit tokens & the governor can withdraw any `fees`. Otherwise, the contract lays dormant. At any point in any of the time periods, flashloaning (of `depositToken` or `rewardToken` only) and arbitrary calls (to contracts != `depositToken` || `rewardToken`) can be performed by anyone and governance respectively.


<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>

##### Claiming period
After `endDepositLock`, deposits can be reclaimed by burning the receipt tokens received from depositing. After `endRewardLock`, any earned rewards should be claimable via `claimReward` function. 
<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>
